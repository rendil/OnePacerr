## Automated One Pace downloads and metadata for Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby

### Built to complement your Sonarr stack

Because Sonarr does not natively support [One
Pace](https://onepace.net/) (the fan-edited, manga-accurate version of One Piece), this app
bridges the gap by automatically downloading, organizing, and keeping your One Pace
episodes fully up to date both on your disk, and on your Media Server of chosing (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby).

Other than organizing your episode files, it also updates metadata and posters so that it looks nice and professional on your Media Server.

It supports the most popular torrenting clients (qBittorrent, deluge and µTorrent) and the most popular Media Servers (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby), or it can even be used without a torrenting client or a Media Server at all.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Discovery:** Continuously pulls One Pace's RSS Release feed and
  metadata to detect missing and new releases.
- **Smart Library Scanning:** Scans your existing Media Server (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby) or Local Folder Library to compare latest episodes against your local files.
- **File Verification (Optional):** Hashes existing files to ensure they match the latest
  releases and automatically re-downloads outdated versions.
- **File Organization (Optional):** Scans your existing Media Server (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby) or Local Folder library and renames files accordingly when needed.
- **Seamless Downloading (Optional):** Automatically sends `magnetURI` links to torrent client for
  missing episodes.

- **Torrent Monitoring (Optional):** Tracks download progress. Once completed, it:
  - Copies and renames the file to your designated Library folder.
  - Updates the metadata either directly on your Media Server (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby) or creates the files on your Local Folder for later imports.
  - Assigns a custom (`completed`) category to the processed torrents.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🧳 Prerequisites

Before running OnePacerr, ensure you have the following services up and running:

- **Docker & Docker Compose** (or k8s, or custom app in Truenas or equivalent)
  - Alternatively you can run it locally with node:
    - create a `.env` file in root (use `sample.env` as example)
    - `npm install`
    - `npm run build`
    - `npm start`
- **one of these torrent clients** (with WebUI/APIs enabled)
  - [qBittorrent](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/qbittorrent) (Recommended)
  - [Deluge](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/deluge)
  - More torrenting clients coming
- You can simply organize a Local Folder, but the best use case is to organize your Media Server of choosing:
  - [**Plex Media Server**](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/plex)
  - [**Jellyfin**](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/jellyfin)
  - [**Emby**](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/emby)

### 📝 Recommended configs

#### 🐔 Base Operation

If your files are nicely named and organized and if your Media Server has all the metadata, you can safely leave these as true (default) or not declare them at all:

```dotenv
# 🐔 BASE CONFIG WHEN YOUR LIBRARY IS ALREADY WELL ORGANIZED
PIPELINE_SKIP_VERIFY_PRESENT_FILES=true
PIPELINE_SKIP_ORGANIZE_PRESENT_FILES=true
PIPELINE_SKIP_UPDATE_METADATA_PRESENT_FILES=true
```

This will prevent the app to verify hash (CRC32 hashing can take a while depending on your machine), to verify Media Server file names (and rename where necessary) and to update metadata for **the files that are already present on it**.

#### 🐣 First Run

My recommendation **when Media Server already has some/all of the episodes** is to run it once with the following configs, so that every file is gonna get verified to be up to date and all metadata is gonna be imported.

```dotenv
# 🐣 RECOMMENDED CONFIG FOR FIRST RUN
PIPELINE_SKIP_VERIFY_PRESENT_FILES=false
PIPELINE_SKIP_ORGANIZE_PRESENT_FILES=false
PIPELINE_SKIP_UPDATE_METADATA_PRESENT_FILES=false
```

After the app is done processing all of the present seasons/episodes, it's gonna continue monitoring for completed downloads and import as usual.

You can also optionally disable downloads for this first run, then stop the app once it's done and update the env vars to keep it running with the basic config.

## ⚡ Usage

### 🐳 Deploy via Docker

The recommended way to deploy is via `docker-compose`.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file and copy the configuration below. Make sure to update
the environment variables and volume mounts to match your server's setup.

I listed every env variable for convenience. All default are commented out, except the most critical.

```yaml

### 🟢 Running locally

Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (>=24 tested) on your machine then:

- create a `.env` file in root (use `sample.env` as example)
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run build`
- run `npm start`

### 👩‍💻 Contributing to the development

For developing first install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, I recommend opening two side-by side tabs in vs code terminal and running one of these in each:

```bash
#Compile typescript and watch for changes
#if you have typescript installed globally `npm i -g typescript`
tsc -w
#otherwise you can do
npx tsc -w


#Shortcut for nodemon --enable-source-maps dist/index.js
#runs app and reloads any time tsc-w recompiles an edited file
npm run dev
```

## ⚙️ Environment Variables Explained

Here is a breakdown of key optional variables you can adjust in your
`docker-compose.yml` or in your `.env` file:

- ⭐ Mandatory
- 🍤 Can leave empty but double check default works for you
- 🍏 Useful
- 💭 These configuration are specific to your chosen Media Server type (`$LIBRARY_MEDIA_SERVER`) so you only need to specify the ones for your case.

### General

| General Variables | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Can be `critical`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`. |
| `LOG_OUTPUT` | `text` | Can be set to `json` if you need to scrape your logs with Loki/Promtail for Grafana. |

### 🧪 Pipeline

| Pipeline Variables | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🍏 `PIPELINE_SKIP_VERIFY_PRESENT_FILES` | `true` | If `false`, hashes files present in Plex upon metadata updates to ensure they are the latest/wanted versions. |
| 🍏 `PIPELINE_SKIP_VERIFY_NOT_FOR_EXTENDED` | `false` | If `true`, PIPELINE_SKIP_VERIFY_PRESENT_FILES only applies to episodes without extended or alternate versions |
| 🍏 `PIPELINE_SKIP_ORGANIZE_PRESENT_FILES` | `true` | If `false`, makes sure the files existing on your Library are in the correct folder and named correctly. |
| 🍏 `PIPELINE_SKIP_UPDATE_METADATA_PRESENT_FILES` | `true` | If `false`, automatically updates metadata for files already in your Library, otherwise only does so for new downloads. |
| 🍏 `PIPELINE_SKIP_DOWNLOADS` | `false` | If `true`, skips download. Use if you only want to organize your current files. |
| 🍏 `PIPELINE_SKIP_DOWNLOADS_IMPORTS` | `false` | If `true`, skips updating posters when updating metadata. |
| `PIPELINE_FORCE_REDOWNLOAD` | `false` | If `true`, downloads and imports files even if already present. |
| `PIPELINE_SKIP_POSTERS` | `false` | If `true`, skips updating posters when updating metadata. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PIPELINE_INCLUDE_SPECIALS` | `false` | Set to `true` to also process specials. |
| `PIPELINE_PREFER_EXTENDED` | `false` | Set to `true` to prioritize extended cuts over standard releases. |
| `PIPELINE_PREFER_ALTERNATE` | `false` | Set to `true` to prefer the G-8 cut at the end of Skypiea. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PIPELINE_FILTERS_INCLUDE` | _None_ | Only process seasons/episodes that match these [filters](#-filters). |
| `PIPELINE_FILTERS_EXCLUDE` | _None_ | Only process seasons/episodes that don't match these [filters](#-filters). |
| `PIPELINE_RETRY_INTERVAL` | 10 | Seconds to wait before re-running pipeline after failures. |

### 🥟 Muhn Pace

Muhn Pace fills One Pace dub gaps that have no RSS/torrent feed by downloading verified `.mp4` files directly from Pixeldrain, using CRC32 entries vendored in `muhn-pace-sources.json`. When `PREFER_MUHN_PACE` is set, eligible episodes route through the Muhn Pace downloader instead of RSS/torrent; everything else behaves exactly as before. Run `npm run sync-muhn-sources` to refresh the vendored source index.

| Muhn Pace Variables | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PREFER_MUHN_PACE` | `false` | When `true`, eligible episodes use Muhn CRC + Pixeldrain instead of RSS/torrent. |
| `MUHN_PACE_DOWNLOAD_DIR` | `<downloads>/muhn-pace` | Staging directory for Muhn Pace HTTP downloads. |
| `MUHN_PACE_SOURCES_PATH` | `./muhn-pace-sources.json` | Path to the vendored Muhn Pace source index JSON. |
| `MUHN_PACE_FALLBACK_TO_ONE_PACE` | `true` | Fall back to One Pace RSS/torrent when a Muhn episode has no Pixeldrain source. |
| `MUHN_PACE_MAX_STAGING_FILES` | `5` | Max completed Muhn downloads allowed to sit in staging awaiting import (backpressure). |
| `MUHN_PACE_DOWNLOAD_INTERVAL` | `TORRENT_CHECK_INTERVAL` | Seconds between Muhn Pace download ticks. |
| `MUHN_PACE_IMPORT_INTERVAL` | `15` | Seconds between Muhn Pace import ticks. |

### 🔎 Filters

`PIPELINE_FILTERS_INCLUDE` and `PIPELINE_FILTERS_EXCLUDE` are lists of 'filters' as a comma separated string. For example: `filter1,filter2,filter3`.

Each filter can either match a specific season number, episode number or both. Meaning they can either be `Sxx`, `SxxExx` or `Exx`. For example `S01E06` would **match** only S01E06, whilst `S02` would **match** every episode in `S02`, and `E06` would **match** episode 6 of every season (don't ask why).

This should give you flexibility to decide to only process whatever you want instead of the whole thing, by combining the `_INCLUDE` and `_EXCLUDE` filters.

Here's a couple of setup examples:

#### Only monitor S16E09 (Probably because you want to re-watch '32:54')

```dotenv
PIPELINE_FILTERS_INCLUDE=S16E09
```

#### Monitor all seasons before Wano (S35)

```dotenv
PIPELINE_FILTERS_EXCLUDE=S35,S36
```

#### Monitor all first episodes of each Season

```dotenv
PIPELINE_FILTERS_INCLUDE=E01
```

#### Monitor all first episodes of each Season, except Wano and Egghead (35,36)

```dotenv
PIPELINE_FILTERS_INCLUDE=E01
PIPELINE_FILTERS_EXCLUDE=S35,S36
```

In order for an episode to be Monitored (processed/downloaded/updated/etc), it has to match BOTH filters.

### 🎬 Library (Common)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Configure the Library (Media Server) type here.
>
> `none` just organizes files in a folder, when metadata is updated it creates `.plexmatch`, `.nfo`, `poster.png` and all of the files that can be then used to automatically add metadata if imported to a Media Server at a later time.
>
> `plex` Plex Media Server.
>
> `jellyfin` Jellyfin Media Server.
>
> `emby` Emby Media Server.

| Library Variables | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ⭐ `LIBRARY_MEDIA_SERVER` | `plex` | Media server, can be either `plex`, `jellyfin`, `emby` or `none` if you just want to organize files in a folder. |
| 🍤 `LIBRARY_SERIES_NAME` | `One Pace` | Name of the Series in Media Server. |
| `LIBRARY_SERIES_FOLDER_NAME` | `$LIBRARY_SERIES_NAME` | Override if Media Server folder needs to be called differently from `LIBRARY_SERIES_NAME`. |
| `LIBRARY_FILENAME_FORMAT` | `{SERIES_NAME} - S{ARC}E{EPISODE} - {TITLE}.mkv` | Overrides the filename each file should have, `{SERIES_NAME}`, `{ARC}`, `{EPISODE}` and `{TITLE}` will be replaced with values. `.mkv` automatically added if not specified. |
| `LIBRARY_CREATE_SHOW_IF_NOT_FOUND` | `true` | If `false`, the app crashes if "LIBRARY_SERIES_NAME" isn't already a Show in your Media Server (useful for catching typos on first setup). Leave `true` to auto-create the show. |

---

### 📂 Library (Local Folder)

| 💭 Library - None | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🍤 `LIBRARY_NONE_ROOT_FOLDER` | `C:\\OnePacerr` | The root folder where your Library should be saved (Do not Include LIBRARY_SERIES_FOLDER_NAME). |

---

### 🍊 Library (Plex Media Server)

| 💭 Library - Plex Variables | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ⭐ `PLEX_URL` | `http://localhost:32400` | Plex URL. |
| ⭐ `PLEX_TOKEN` | _None_ | Your [Plex Token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/). |
| 🍤 `PLEX_LIBRARY_NAME` | `TV Shows` | Name of the Library in Plex. |
| `PLEX_SKIP_METADATA_FILES` | `true` | If `false`, will generate `.nfo` and poster pngs even when Media Server is Plex. |
| `PLEX_PLEXMATCH_EVEN_IF_NOT` | `false` | If `true`, will generate `.plexmatch` file even when using a different Media Sever. |

**Note** on `PLEX_SKIP_METADATA_FILES`: Metadata for plex is set via API because doing so with just the files is unreliable at best. For this reason, when `LIBRARY_MEDIA_SERVER` is set to `plex`, by default (`PLEX_SKIP_METADATA_FILES=true`) OnePacerr will not generate the `.nfo` and the various `poster.png` on the Media Server folder.

If you set `PLEX_SKIP_METADATA_FILES=false`, you can instead generate those files regardless. This is useful if you want to use the same media folder for multiple Media Servers, or if you just would rather create all of the metadata in case you ever change Media Server (it doesn't take that much space anyways).

## 🖼️ Poster Sets

### 🔍 Previews

You can preview all of the custom poster sets at the following links:

- [piratezekk (default)](docs/poster%20previews/piratezekk.md#show)
- [mizzoufan523](docs/poster%20previews/mizzoufan523.md#show)
- [official](docs/poster%20previews/official.md#show)

When a poster is missing from the set, you will se a placeholder in these preview.
